A rudimentary web application created using predominantly ASP.NET web forms and a SQL Database.
The intended purpose was to practice standard CRUD SQL queries and familiarise myself with ASP.NET through the lens of a "Student Management System".
This project was created roughly during april 2024, and was my first C# related project.

Familiarity with other coding languages like C++ and Javascript laid a solid foundation for approaching this project, and while Database management
and querying was new territory for me, I found both quite intuitive. I am glad to say that at this point, database creation and management is one
of my personal favourite parts of any given software project.

I was fortunate enough in my studies to be given a second attempt at making a Learner Management System in our capstone project, viewable as the "TanglewoodLMS".
